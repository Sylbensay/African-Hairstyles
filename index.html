            <h3>Aesthetic significance</h3>
            <p class="text-left" id="to-cadi">Just as the social significance of hair was important, so was its aesthetic appeal. According to Sylvia Ardyn Boone, an anthropologist who specializes in the Mende culture of Sierra Leone, “West African communities admire a fine head of long, thick hair on a woman. A woman with long thick hair demonstrates the life force, the multiplying power of profusion, prosperity, a ‘green thumb’ for bountiful farms and many healthy children” (Tharps and Byrd 2001) Howeverh, there was more to being beautiful than having long tresses. One’s hair also had to be neat, clean, and arranged in a certain style. These styles included cornrows, and other braided styles. They also adorned the hair with ornaments such as beads and cowrie shells.</p>

            <h3>Cadi(kah-dee)-  Sierra Leone (Mende women)</h3>
            <p class="text-left">This is a modification of cornrows worn by the Mende women in Sierra Leone. Africans have traditionally worn cornrows for certain festivals and celebrations or as a regular daily hairstyle. Members of the Mende and  Temne groups in Africa might spend hours or even days creating a cornrow style and cornrowing is regarded as an art as well as a hairstyling technique.

            <h3>Fulani Braids</h3>
            <p class="text-left">A very traditional hairstyle for women of the fulani culture. The hair is decorated with beads and cowrie shells. A tradition that is passed through the generations to women and young girls includes attaching the family’s silver coins and amber onto braids as a heritage symbol as well as for aesthetic purposes.</p>

            <h3> Ghana Weave </h3>
            <p class="text-left">Ghana braids can trace their roots all the way back to West Africa. In centuries past they were an integral part of many different ethnic, religious, social, and cultural traditions. The earliest depictions of Ghana braids appear in hieroglyphics and sculptures carved around 500 BC.What makes Ghana braiding so different from the traditional cornrowing is the start– aligning with the hairline to each braid causing it to seem way more soft and natural. In Ghana braiding the hair is pulled in smaller pieces with edge control like paste to create a slick and chic look. Ghana Braids are usually only 4-8 braids.

            <h3>Himba</h3>
            <p class="text-left">With the Himbas, from the time one is born, his or her hairstyle visually identifies one’s place in his or her society. This is especially true for females. For example, a young girl who hasn’t reached puberty yet, will display two braids at the front of her head until she reaches puberty. If a girl is a twin, though, then she will wear only one single braid.

            <p class="text-left">The Koroba style originates from the yoruba people in Nigeria. The braidings radiate from the center of the head to all parts, like an upturned bucket or container. Koroba means bucket in the yoruba language.

            <h3>Threading</h3>
            <p class="text-left">Irun Kiko—Yoruba translation for “threaded hair.” Irun Kiko pays homage to hair threading, which originated among the Yoruba people of Nigeria. Threading hairstyles were used to depict socio cultural affluence, as some of the styles are made to resemble crowns or skyscrapers. This hairstyle involves the use of cotton, rubber, silk, or wool threads to completely cover sectioned hair from root to tip.Threading stretches the hair and is faster than plaiting.

            <h3>Two Shukwu</h3>
            <p class="text-left">Shukwu (also called Suku or Shuku , means basket). This is quite simple and it is one of the most popular in Nigeria. It is a form of braiding in which the hair runs from the forehead to the nape of the neck or forms a rump on top of the head. At a time, it was only the wives of kings that could make shuku but that change over time and anyone can now adorn the style. When shuku is blended with koroba, it is called orishabumn.
